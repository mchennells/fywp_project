  library(data.table)

  library(pwr)

## FY/WP : DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS

Blurb on descriptives

```{r read_data, echo = FALSE}

rm(list = ls())



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
